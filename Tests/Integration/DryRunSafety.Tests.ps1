.SYNOPSIS
    Proves that -DryRun reaches the apply pipeline without writing anything.
.DESCRIPTION
    Tagged DryRun rather than ReadOnly on purpose. The whole point is to assert
    that nothing is written, which means a regression in the dry-run guard would
    write to the host running the test. Run it on an ephemeral machine (CI) or
    inside Windows Sandbox, never on a workstation you care about.

    The assertion targets the exact values the selected feature would change,
    read out of its .reg file, rather than sweeping the registry broadly.
